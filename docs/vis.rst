vis - Compute visibility (PVS) for a Quake BSP file

Synopsis
========

**vis** [OPTION]... BSPFILE

Description
===========

**vis** is a tool used in the creation of maps for the game Quake. vis
looks for a .prt file by stripping the file extension from BSPFILE (if
any) and appending ".prt". vis then calculates the potentially visible
set (PVS) information before updating the .bsp file, overwriting any
existing PVS data.

This vis tool supports the PRT2 format for Quake maps with detail
brushes. See the qbsp documentation for details.

Compiling a map (without the -fast parameter) can take a long time, even
days or weeks in extreme cases. Vis will attempt to write a state file
every five minutes so that progress will not be lost in case the
computer needs to be rebooted or an unexpected power outage occurs.

Options
=======

.. program:: vis

.. option:: -threads n

   Set number of threads explicitly. By default vis will attempt to
   detect the number of CPUs/cores available.

.. option:: -fast

   Skip detailed calculations and calculate a very loose set of PVS
   data. Sometimes useful for a quick test while developing a map.

.. option:: -level n

   Select a test level from 0 to 4 for detailed visibility calculations.
   Lower levels are not necessarily faster in in all cases. It is not
   recommended that you change the default level unless you are
   experiencing problems. Default 4.

.. option:: -v

   Verbose output.

.. option:: -vv

   Very verbose output.

.. option:: -noambientsky

   Disable ambient sound generation for textures with names beginning
   with 'SKY'.

.. option:: -noambientwater

   Disable ambient sound generation for textures with names beginning
   with '*WATER' or '*04WATER'.

.. option:: -noambientslime

   Disable ambient sound generation for textures with names beginning
   with '*SLIME'.

.. option:: -noambientlava

   Disable ambient sound generation for textures with names beginning
   with '*LAVA'.

.. option:: -noambient

   Disable all ambient sound generation.

.. option:: -visdist n
   
   Allow culling of areas further than n units.
